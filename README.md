---------------------------- Answer to the question no. 1 ----------------------------

Assignment Code: After implementing each of the module I pushed my code on my https://github.com/AhmedDiderRahat/fs-wise2122 link.




---------------------------- Answer to the question no. 2 ----------------------------

UML Diagram: UML stands for Unified Modeling Language. Its help to specify, visualize, and document models of software systems, including their structure and design. 
These portion I will expalin 3 standard UML diagrams: 
													1.	Use case diagram 
													2.	Activity diagram 
													3.	State diagram
													
						-> Use Case Diagram: In my use case diagram there are 2 actors and 7 use case. 
						-> Activity diagram: In activity diagram we can see the interaction between each activity to others. 
						-> State diagram: Hold the state of the system.

						-> All the figure is stored into following directory: 
												https://github.com/AhmedDiderRahat/fs-wise2122/tree/main/report/2%20-%20Three%20Diagram 
												
												


												
---------------------------- Answer to the question no. 3 ----------------------------

Domain Driven Design (DDD): There are 3 domain in my system user management, app data management, and app data use (from other application). 

The screen shrot is given as follow: https://github.com/AhmedDiderRahat/fs-wise2122/tree/main/report/3%20-%20DDD 




---------------------------- Answer to the question no. 4 ----------------------------

SonarCloud Metrics: I have done the metics work by using sonarCloud. 

SS link:  https://github.com/AhmedDiderRahat/fs-wise2122/tree/main/report/4%20-%20sonarCloud 

Cloud link is: https://sonarcloud.io/summary/overall?id=AhmedDiderRahat_fs-wise2122   





---------------------------- Answer to the question no. 5 ----------------------------

Clean Code Development: In my coding implementation, I try to do clean coding. 

		-> 5 points for clean code: 
									1.	Naming Convension: Throughout the project I tried to give all the variable a meaningfull name.
									2.	Write meaningfull comment: I write comment whenever it needed. 
									3.	Do not use long parameter: I didn’t use any mehod with a long paremeter list instead of making a data class object to passed it. Screnshort can be found: 
									4.	Error handing: I handle all the possible errors. For that I used null checking as well as try…catch methods.
									5.	Remove unused code: After completing each module, I removed the unused code/import. 

									All of Screnshort can be found: https://github.com/AhmedDiderRahat/fs-wise2122/tree/main/report/5A%20-%20Clean%20Code 
									
									
		-> 10 points for cheat sheet: As I used kotlin as my development languagae. So, I used  cheat sheet for kotlin and core software development concept.

---------------------------- Answer to the question no. 6 ----------------------------			
			
Build Management: As I developed an adroid appliation, I use kotlin as programming language and android studio as my IDE. So I build my apk using android studio manager. 

APK link: https://github.com/AhmedDiderRahat/fs-wise2122/tree/main/report/6%20-%20Build%20management 




---------------------------- Answer to the question no. 7 ----------------------------			

Unit test implemenetation: I implement unit test to check wheter the app name is correct or not. All the unit test codes are implemented to unittest pacakage. I used one dependency named “com.google.truth:truth:1.0.1” for implement unit test.

---------------------------- Answer to the question no. 8 ----------------------------		
Continuous Delivery: I used circleci as the countinous integration platfor. I make a branch for circleci in git and connect that branch with circleci. 

The cofigaration file and and ss are given in the link: https://github.com/AhmedDiderRahat/fs-wise2122/tree/main/report/8%20-%20Continuous%20delivery 





---------------------------- Answer to the question no. 9 ----------------------------	

-> IDE and key-shortcut: I used android studio as my IDE. In android studio I have some favourite key shortcuts. Some of them are:
						
						--> CTRL+ALT+L for format the code of a page. Its very useful to format the code by just  using this cimmand. As formting increse the code  readabily, so often I used this command. 
						
						--> CTRL+space for getting the suggestion for any library function or already declare varible. 
						--> ALT+enter for import any library if its not imported automatically. 


						
						
						
---------------------------- Answer to the question no. 10 ----------------------------	


-> DES: I assume one portion of my domain is to rate the name of an user. Here, rating means the occurance of the name. I also assume that, the calculation could be happened into another remote site. 

--> The code segment is written into dsl package and the link is: https://github.com/AhmedDiderRahat/fs-wise2122/tree/main/report/10%20-%20DSL 





---------------------------- Answer to the question no. 11 ----------------------------	

-> Functional Programming: 
						--> Only final data structures: In kotlin the final variable is expresse as val. I have used in my code.
						-->	Side Effect free function: A function that doesn’t effect the state of the external object is side-efffect free function.
						
						--> Higher-order functions: A higher-order function is a function that takes functions as parameters, or returns a function. In the screen short [3-5] map is a higher order function.
						
						--> Functions as parameters and return values: In the screen short [3-5] random() is pass to other function. 
						--> Anonymous functions: In the screen short [3-5] key_generator is anonymus function.
